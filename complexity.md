#Time Complexity: Time taken by an algorithm to execute

Growth:-
1. Constant: No while loop --> 1
2. Logarithm : When after each iteration the size of the input is divided into half --> log(n)
3. Linear: Simple loop or two loop but they are not nested --> n
4. Quadratic : Two nested loop --> n * n
5. Cubic : Three nested loop --> n * n * n
6. Exponential : 2^n 



Asymptotic notation
1. Big-oh Notation-> For worst case (upperBound)
2. Omega Notation-> For best case (LowerBound)
2. Theta Notation-> Between worst and  best case(Average)

#Space Complexity: Memory used by an algorithm to execute

eg--> Linear search
O(n)--> wrost case
omega(1) --> best case
theta(n/2) = theta(n) --> average case
